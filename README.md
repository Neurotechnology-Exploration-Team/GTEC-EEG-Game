## Contributions
This project is primarily maintained by members of the Neurotechnology Exploration Team of Rochester Institute of Technology. If you would like to participate, please contact the administrators of this repository.

If you are a member of the team, please follow these rules for contributing:
- Never push directly to `main` or `dev`
- `main` always represents the latest release version of the game
- `dev` represents the current development version of the game
  - `dev` may have bugs or other issues that will be resolved before merging to `main`
  - Only `dev` may be merged into `main`, and only by a repository administrators
- Try not to commit files in the `UserSettings` folder, as these are not usually related to your changes

To make a contribution:
1. Create a new branch based off of `dev` with a name that indicates what is being changed
2. Commit and push your changes to your new branch until you are finished
3. Merge the dev branch into your branch to get any changes made since you started
4. Ensure that there are no obvious bugs with your changes
5. Create a pull request to merge your branch into `dev`
6. Add @MJE10, @Fumpledump, and any other desired members as reviewers
7. If reviewers request changes, make and push new commits with the requested changes
8. Once all reviewers have approved the pull request, merge your branch and delete it
